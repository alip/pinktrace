Using **PinkTrace**, it is easily possible to read/change system calls or
system call arguments. This means you can deny a specific system call from
executing altogether or only if a system call argument matches a certain value.
You can also change the system call to execute a different system call or
change the arguments of the system call so it takes a different integer or a
different string as argument.
