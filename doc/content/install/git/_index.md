If you use a GIT version of PinkTrace source code, there will be some files missing
that are needed to build PinkTrace. Some of these files are generated by tools
from the GNU Autoconf and GNU Automake packages.

Note: rather than running `autoreconf` directly, please invoke `./autogen.sh` script
and follow the instructions given in
[INSTALL](https://git.exherbo.org/pinktrace-1.git/plain/README-configure) file for
further building and installation.
